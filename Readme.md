## Comments

- Both backend and frontend images are built with the same `Dockerfile` using the following command:

```bash
docker build --target backend --tag feather-admin-panel-backend .

docker build --target frontend --tag feather-admin-panel-frontend .
```

- Nginx in frontend image is used just as static file server. Another instance should be deployed somewhere for proper setup

- I've implemented a couple of tests for backend and frontend. There could have been a lot more tests added but I'm limited in time

- I haven't used a real database here. Again, I'm limited in time, but I have another test assignment done where I actually did use PostgreSQL with Docker: https://github.com/bakedchicken/n26-test-assignment
